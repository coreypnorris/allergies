##Allergies

####This is a ruby method for determining allergies based on an allergies score

To use it just copy the code from the lib/fizzbuzz.rb file and paste it into a ruby client ([Here's a link](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/installing-ruby) that helped me install ruby on my machine). Then type 'allergies(your-score-here)' in the client.

I built this project while I was a student at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/fizzbuzz-title-case-allergies-psychology-test) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
